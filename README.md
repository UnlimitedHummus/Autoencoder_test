# Autoencoder_test

The Simulation folder houses `training.py`, `testing.py` a folder for tensorboard logs and a folder where the model is saved.
In `training.py` the model gets trained
In `testing.py` a few predictions get made with the model and you can look at how the transmitted images compare to the original ones.
